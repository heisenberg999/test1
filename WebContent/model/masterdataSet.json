Subject: RE: Risk on Key Person Dependency. . Hi Martin,. This is a risk we are all sensitive to, as Hendro has the greatest knowledge of Unilever, and is an invaluable resource on the contract.. . The best way I see to mitigate this risk is to: . . 1. Have Hendro document his knowledge, some of this is captured in network diagrams already and an information repository is in place, but needs more detail such as the way routing is configured on the network, critical sites, major risks.. 2. Share the workload for Philippines with other TD’s. Perhaps have other TD’s doing the less complex SR’s to begin with, and move Hendro to the role where he is mentoring the TD’s doing the work, and gradually increase the complexity of SRs that other TD’s work on. All countries want Hendro to do all their SR’s because he is so knowledgeable and brilliant, but the only way to mitigate the risk is to have other TD’s also doing work on the Philippines.. . Does this approach help? I have copied prince, who is the technical lead for Asia, for any further insights or suggestions he may have.. . Rgds,.

Often on these consumers focussed devices, the ability to support performant encryption is compromised to accommodate better screens, cameras, storage and memory. . . Going forward Google are standardising encryption onto their devices through Android 6.0 and “Android for Work” which ensures devices can be used in a corporate environment. Unilever has also standardised its device catalogues and new device purchases to ensure that any future device is compliant with our security policies.. . However we still have c3.7k devices that do not comply to the encryption requirements as of Oct 5th and will need to be remediated quickly as we approach the ETP deadline. The ETP was initially proposed to run until September next year so these devices will naturally refresh, however the security team have advised these need to be removed and replaced as quickly as possible.

IPhones are encrypted as standard and Windows devices can easily be encrypted, the challenge lies within the Android estate where due to Google’s open standards on the Android Operating System, device manufacturers and mobile carriers have the freedom to choose whether to support encryption or not. Often on these consumers focussed devices, the ability to support performant encryption is compromised to accommodate better screens, cameras, storage and memory. . . Going forward Google are standardising encryption onto their devices through Android 6.0 and “Android for Work” which ensures devices can be used in a corporate environment. Unilever has also standardised its device catalogues and new device purchases to ensure that any future device is compliant with our security policies.. . However we still have c3.7k devices that do not comply to the encryption requirements as of Oct 5th and will need to be remediated quickly as we approach the ETP deadline. The ETP was initially proposed to run until September next year so these devices will naturally refresh, however the security team have advised these need to be removed and replaced as quickly as possible.

Subject: RE: Risk on Key Person Dependency. . Hi Martin,. This is a risk we are all sensitive to, as Hendro has the greatest knowledge of Unilever, and is an invaluable resource on the contract.. . The best way I see to mitigate this risk is to: . . 1. Have Hendro document his knowledge, some of this is captured in network diagrams already and an information repository is in place, but needs more detail such as the way routing is configured on the network, critical sites, major risks.. 2. Share the workload for Philippines with other TD’s. Perhaps have other TD’s doing the less complex SR’s to begin with, and move Hendro to the role where he is mentoring the TD’s doing the work, and gradually increase the complexity of SRs that other TD’s work on. All countries want Hendro to do all their SR’s because he is so knowledgeable and brilliant, but the only way to mitigate the risk is to have other TD’s also doing work on the Philippines.. . Does this approach help? I have copied prince, who is the technical lead for Asia, for any further insights or suggestions he may have.. . Rgds,.

Subject: RE: Risk on Key Person Dependency. . Hi Martin,. This is a risk we are all sensitive to, as Hendro has the greatest knowledge of Unilever, and is an invaluable resource on the contract.. . The best way I see to mitigate this risk is to: . . 1. Have Hendro document his knowledge, some of this is captured in network diagrams already and an information repository is in place, but needs more detail such as the way routing is configured on the network, critical sites, major risks.. 2. Share the workload for Philippines with other TD’s. Perhaps have other TD’s doing the less complex SR’s to begin with, and move Hendro to the role where he is mentoring the TD’s doing the work, and gradually increase the complexity of SRs that other TD’s work on. All countries want Hendro to do all their SR’s because he is so knowledgeable and brilliant, but the only way to mitigate the risk is to have other TD’s also doing work on the Philippines.. . Does this approach help? I have copied prince, who is the technical lead for Asia, for any further insights or suggestions he may have.. . Rgds,.

Subject: RE: Risk on Key Person Dependency. . Hi Martin,. This is a risk we are all sensitive to, as Hendro has the greatest knowledge of Unilever, and is an invaluable resource on the contract.. . The best way I see to mitigate this risk is to: . . 1. Have Hendro document his knowledge, some of this is captured in network diagrams already and an information repository is in place, but needs more detail such as the way routing is configured on the network, critical sites, major risks.. 2. Share the workload for Philippines with other TD’s. Perhaps have other TD’s doing the less complex SR’s to begin with, and move Hendro to the role where he is mentoring the TD’s doing the work, and gradually increase the complexity of SRs that other TD’s work on. All countries want Hendro to do all their SR’s because he is so knowledgeable and brilliant, but the only way to mitigate the risk is to have other TD’s also doing work on the Philippines.. . Does this approach help? I have copied prince, who is the technical lead for Asia, for any further insights or suggestions he may have.. . Rgds,.

Subject: RE: Risk on Key Person Dependency. . Hi Martin,. This is a risk we are all sensitive to, as Hendro has the greatest knowledge of Unilever, and is an invaluable resource on the contract.. . The best way I see to mitigate this risk is to: . . 1. Have Hendro document his knowledge, some of this is captured in network diagrams already and an information repository is in place, but needs more detail such as the way routing is configured on the network, critical sites, major risks.. 2. Share the workload for Philippines with other TD’s. Perhaps have other TD’s doing the less complex SR’s to begin with, and move Hendro to the role where he is mentoring the TD’s doing the work, and gradually increase the complexity of SRs that other TD’s work on. All countries want Hendro to do all their SR’s because he is so knowledgeable and brilliant, but the only way to mitigate the risk is to have other TD’s also doing work on the Philippines.. . Does this approach help? I have copied prince, who is the technical lead for Asia, for any further insights or suggestions he may have.. . Rgds,.
